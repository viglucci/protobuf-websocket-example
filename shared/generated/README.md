The source code found in this folder is likely generated from code generation tools such as [protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf).

This code is checked into the repository for ease of use when cloning the repository to experiment, as well as to show a 'complete picture' for anyone browsing the repository online, however it may be considered bad practice to commit generated code to source control, such as git.
